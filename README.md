- 👋 Hi, I’m Francisco Munguia Wulftange and I am a physics student at the University of San Diego.
- I am learning python and would love to learn more coding languages in the future. 
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in particle physics, quantum mechanics and nuclear fusion. I would love to work at a nuclear fusion reactor or in the particle astrophysics field.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning neutrino physics, specifically studying an outside the standard model called the sterile neutrino,
-    which is a dark matter candidate.
-    
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on particle physics research! I would also love to learn how to work with computational plasma models 
-    for fusion reactors. 
-    
- 📫 How to reach me, Email: fdwulftange@gmail.com, or fmunguiawulftang@sandiego.edu.
- (Reach out by email and we can set up a call or a zoom call. I also like to communicate through text.)
